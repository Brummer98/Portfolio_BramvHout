### Agile methods

#### What is agile?
Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

#### What agile methods are there?
1. SCRUM
2. Kanban
3. Extreme Programming (XP)
4. Lean Development
5. Crystal

#### What are the advantages of the methods?
##### SCRUM
###### Advantages
* Team motivation is good because programmers want to meet the deadline for every sprint
* Transparency allows the project to be followed by all the members in a team or even throughout the organisation
* A simple “definition of done” is used for validating requirements
* Focus on quality is a constant with the scrum method, resulting in fewer mistakes
* The dynamics of this method allow developers to reorganise priorities, ensuring that sprints that have not yet been completed get more attention
* Good sprint planning is prioritised, so that the whole scrum team understands the “why, what and how” of allocated tasks
###### Disadvantages
* The segmentation of the project and the search for the agility of development can sometimes lead the team to lose track of the project as a whole, focusing on a single part
* Every developer role may not be well defined, resulting in some confusion amongst team members

##### Kanban
###### Advantages
* Ability to view all the tasks under a single project (by Completed, In Progress or In testing, for example) using the simple concept of “Cards”
* You can limit the number of running tasks (that is, the amount of work, bearing its resolution or deliverability in mind)
* Focuses on the duration of a cycle – how long it takes a task to go from backlog to final stage
* Allows continuous deliveries
* Probably one of the simplest methodologies to implement outside the “IT world”
###### Disadvantages
* It’s possible for team members to misinterpret the information shown on the Kanban Board, especially when it is shown as outdated
* Since there are no timeframes in Kanban, you can face time-related problems, such as delays, at each and every stage

##### Extreme Programming (XP)
###### Advantages
* The simplicity of the written code is an advantage since it allows for improvement at any given time
* The whole process and the XP development cycle is visible, creating goals for developers along with relatively rapid results
* Software development is more agile than when using other methodologies, due to constant testing
* Promotes a highly energising way of working
* XP also contributes to uplifting and maintaining team talent
###### Disadvantages
* The extreme focus on code can lead to less importance being paid to design, meaning that it has to get extra attention later
* This framework may not work at its best if all the team members are not situated in the same geographical area
* In XP projects, a registry of possible errors is not always maintained, and this lack of monitoring can lead to similar bugs in the future

##### Lean Development
###### Advantages
* Allows the team to delete superfluous activity, therefore saving time and money
* Decreases the time needed to deliver functionalities, since it prepares the development team during the decision-making process, hence increasing general motivation
* Easily scalable methodology, easily adaptable to projects of any dimension
* Does not over-engineer solutions or business requirements
###### Disadvantages
* Dependent on the development team’s ability and on following “Lean principles”, which requires extremely dedicated and talented developers
* It is easier to lose focus since various tasks are divided into a number of elements
* Requires some documents, in particular on the characteristics of the business that is the subject of the work. Otherwise, there is a risk that the development may be carried out incorrectly and present errors

##### Crystal
###### Advantages
* Crystal requires frequent deliveries, in order to identify eventual problems at every stage
* There is always space to improve characteristics, taking some time from software development and allowing for discussions about how to perfect processes
* Facilitates closer communication within teams and promotes interaction and knowledge-sharing between team members
* Requires a technical environment with automated tests, configuration management and frequent integration
###### Disadvantages
* The fact that there are variants in the methodology family means that the principles might vary with the size of the team and the size of the project, resulting in projects that might not be so straightforward
* It might not work best for geographically scattered teams, because of the constant need to communicate and reflect
* Planning and development are not dependent on requirements
* It is ideal for experienced, autonomous teams
