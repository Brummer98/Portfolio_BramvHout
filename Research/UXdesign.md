## UX design research
I've done some research on what kind of UX designs i could implement into my own project. I Actually started with researching what kind of frontend framework to use
for the FitOne project.

### What are frontend frameworks?
A front end framework gives developers a nice selective set of elements to their availablity. With those elements they can easily and quickly create a frame for a 
responsive website or webapplication.

### Frontend components
Frontend frameworks comprehend the following components:
* The grid makes it easy to establish the design features of your site
* Well-defined font styles that differ based on its purpose
* Pre-built site components like buttons, navigation bars, and side panels

### Benefits of a frontend framework
* Features and applications are reasonably more responsive
* Rapid development with the consequences that are user-driven
* Delivers real-time programming
* Technology with several benefits: easy to scale, learn and use

### Frontend frameworks i've looked into
1. React JS
2. Angular 
3. Vue

#### React JS < My personal choice!
![React JS](https://www.monocubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/reactjs-dev.png) \
A front-end framework, React stands apart because of its virtual Document Object Model (DOM), which presents its excellent functionality. 
It is a perfect framework for those who expect high traffic and require a steady platform to manage it.

Furthermore, this framework is user-friendly for new developers – the guides also aid to deal with any complications that happen during the learning process.

###### Advantages
* Saving time while re-utilizing components
* Virtual DOM enhances both the experience of the users and the work of the developer
* An open-source library with a diversity of tools
* The steady code is supplied by one direction data movement

###### Disadvantages
* Absence of documentation due to significant pace development
* The comparatively long learning curve
* The developers find it challenging to comprehend the complications of JSX

###### Why i chose React JS
Next to React being one of the more populair frameworks to use, it was very easy to learn and understand. Also, a classmate of mine told me about how awesome it was
and so i started doing research to React first. It also has a lot of tools within the library that you can easily make use of. Next to that i also started doing some
more research to see if u could combine the framework with ***Bootstrap***. Which you can read [here](#bootstrap-with-react-js).

#### Angular
![Angular](https://www.monocubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/angular.jpg) \
In contrast to React, Angular is exclusive with its two-way data binding trait. It means that there is actual time synchronization between view and model, 
where any alteration in the model replicates promptly on view and vice versa.

###### Advantages
* Making the coding procedure easier due to its refactoring services and enhanced navigation
* The component-based pattern of Angular sanctions forms a user interface with single components
* Large Ecosystem
* Angular Material reorganizes Material Design interface production
* High Performance

###### Disadvantages
* Angular complication
* Relocating legacy schemes from AngularJS to Angular
* The CLI documentation is not fairly defined
* The learning effort

#### Vue
![Vue](https://www.monocubed.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mb-vue-js.jpg) \
Nowadays, one of the simplest frameworks is Vue.js. It is worthy of eliminating the intricacies that Angular software developers face.

It has a small size and presents two main benefits – visual DOM and component-based. It is also employs two-way data binding. This frontend framework is versatile, and it aids you with various tasks when building web applications.

From constructing web and mobile applications to progressive web apps (PWA), it can manage both dynamic and simple developments with simplicity.

###### Advantages
* Extensive and detailed documentation
* Simplicity and clarity
* Browser dev tools extensions
* Code reusability and simple integration

###### Disadvantages
* Reduced developers’ community
* Flexibility leads to code irregularities

### Bootstrap with React JS
Bootstrap, which is a frontend toolkit, was very easy to use with React JS. In previous projects where i did not use React JS, i did use Bootstrap to make my site more powerful and responsive. So naturally, i looked up if i could implement Bootstrap into my new project that was also using React JS. It was easy to install Bootstrap
by using the ***NPM*** package manager like so: \
![Bootstrap install](https://github.com/Brummer98/Portfolio_BramvHout/blob/ba6972f2ac7ce4d7c2823c4fda445c6ac06328d1/img/BT_1.png) 

Then if u wanted any type of component on your page, you could easily do that by importing the component that u need, like so:
![Bootstrap imports](https://github.com/Brummer98/Portfolio_BramvHout/blob/ba6972f2ac7ce4d7c2823c4fda445c6ac06328d1/img/BT_2.png) 

And finally you'd have to configure the global files that Bootstrap offers, like so:

By doing this kind of research on different types of frameworks and toolkits, i help improve my proficiency for learning outcome 6: ***Requirements and design***.
