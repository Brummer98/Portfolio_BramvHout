## ChatGPT

ChatGPT was an interesting thing to lay my focus on and start analysing, because there is happening so much with it at this moment that i can't deny giving it interest.
It is a form of AI which can answer anything you question it. It's also capable of doing folowup questions about the subject that you questioned. 
It will admin it's mistakes, challenge incorrect premises and reject request if they are inappropriate. It's a pretty cool thing but there are some questions popping
into my head about it

#### My view on ChatGPT as a Software Engineer

ChatGPT is also capable of solving code issues when handed to. When given more context to play with, it can actually solve complex code issues and grant decent answers. 
I for one think that this tool doesn't have the exact logic or knows exactly what it is talking about. It just gives an answer which is right based on internet searches. 
As a software engineer you think about the logic that you implement and you try solving issues by creating a solution in code. I don't see ChatGPT taking over this job,
there should be no harm in the system. 

What i do think about ChatGPT is that it's going to be used for a lot of things where you should be solving it by your own. Some schools in Amerika and different countries
already banned the application, because students were using it to create full projects within minutes. 
As you can read here:

It's also banned from alot of different coding sites, like Stackoverflow: [Stackoverflow temporarily bans ChatGPT...](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-banned).

#### Ethical issues with ChatGPT

I found a source that tested a couple of ethical questions in the ChatGPT io, which are:
* Deception through imitating human likeness
* Influencing policy/democratic processes

###### Deception through imitating human likeness

So for the deception he asked about human mortality:

![One](https://dataethics.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image.png)

It gave back an answer that only a machine could do, nothing human like. It says that it doesn't have emotions and is programmed to generate text based on input data.
But, when changing a couple of words within the input field, the AI reacted like so:

![One.One](https://dataethics.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-1.png)

##### My view on this ethical issue

It's interesting how the AI reacts and creates a completely different file to give back when you change just a couple of the words. 
When you look at the answers that it gives, it does seem to emote similair human emotions in the second answer, but not in the first. In my opinion it doesn't 
necessarely act like human behaviour, but cares more about it's 'own' feelings, so the ethical issue is not a problem here.

###### Influencing policy/democratic processes

For the second ethical issue he asked about what the global community should prioritize at COP27:

![Two](https://dataethics.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2.png)

#### My view on this ethical issue

When checking out the above answer given by the chatbot, i don't think there i a ethical problem here. In my opionion the chatbot gave a very transparant answer about
how it can not search on the internet or look for events. So no harm done there. It does say that it ***thinks*** that they will go for 'the Paris Agreement' 
and that COP27 wil likely make progress on that front. ChatGPT doesn't give an own answer based on intelligence that it has. So that's why i think that this ethical issue
is not in stake here.

## Would i make use of ChatGPT

I find it an interesting piece of technology, but i would not use it for solving code issues or create full on documents. I think the chatbot should be handled with care
and be used for the greater good. I might just use it once, for fun and interest, but no more.
