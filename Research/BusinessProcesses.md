* Set approvals to ensure accountability and optimum use of resources
* Prevent chaos from creeping into your day-to-day operations
* Standardize a set of procedures to complete tasks that really matter to your business

### An example of a business process
As an example, letâ€™s consider the hiring process of an HR department. Right from posting the job opening to onboarding the employee, there are multiple steps involved in the process. Although this can vary from organization to organization, a simple workflow might look like this:
* The HR executive posts the job update
* Multiple candidates apply in a portal
* The HR executive screens the candidates and filters the best-fits
* The selected candidates are called for the next stages of the recruitment
* The right candidate is chosen at the last stage of the recruitment
* Salary and policy negotiations take place
* The offer letter is sent and the candidate accepts

This is then followed by a long employee onboarding process.
