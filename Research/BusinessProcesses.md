### What is a business process?
A business process is a series of steps performed by a group of stakeholders to achieve a concrete goal. Each step in a business process denotes a task that is assigned to a participant. It is the fundamental building block for several related ideas such as business process management, process automation, etc

### The importance of a business process
The need for and advantages of a business process are quite apparent in large organizations. A process forms the lifeline for any business and helps it streamline individual activities, making sure that resources are put to optimal use

### Key reasons to have well defined business processes
* Identify what tasks are important to your larger business goals
* Improve efficiency
* Streamline communication between people/functions/departments
* Set approvals to ensure accountability and optimum use of resources
* Prevent chaos from creeping into your day-to-day operations
* Standardize a set of procedures to complete tasks that really matter to your business

### An example of a business process
As an example, let’s consider the hiring process of an HR department. Right from posting the job opening to onboarding the employee, there are multiple steps involved in the process. Although this can vary from organization to organization, a simple workflow might look like this:
* The HR executive posts the job update
* Multiple candidates apply in a portal
* The HR executive screens the candidates and filters the best-fits
* The selected candidates are called for the next stages of the recruitment
* The right candidate is chosen at the last stage of the recruitment
* Salary and policy negotiations take place
* The offer letter is sent and the candidate accepts

This is then followed by a long employee onboarding process.

### The seven steps of the business process lifecycle
1. Define your goals
2. Plan and map your process
3. Set actions and assign stakeholders
4. Test the process
5. Implement the process
6. Monitor the results
7. Repeat

### Userstory mapping
User-story mapping (also known as user-story maps, story maps, and story mapping) is a lean UX-mapping method, often practiced by Agile teams, that uses sticky notes and sketches to outline the interactions that the team expects users to go through to complete their goals in a digital product

### Story mapping 3 types of actions
A user-story map depicts 3 types of actions at different granularity: activities (the most general actions), steps, and details (the most specific actions). User activities and steps display horizontally across the top of the map, and the details stack vertically underneath their respective steps in priority order.

1. ***Activities*** represent the high-level tasks that users aim to complete in the digital product — for example, Check account balance or Deposit a check. Depending on the type of application or website you're creating, you may only have a few high-level activities. These can display in sequential order or in parallel if multiple paths for various user types exist. Exploratory research about top user tasks should inform this level of the map.
2. ***Steps*** sit directly underneath activities and also display in sequential order. They represent the specific subtasks that users will go through in the product to complete the activity above. For example, the activity, Deposit a check can be deconstructed into the steps of Enter mobile deposit details, Sign check, Photograph check, Submit deposit, and Confirm deposit.
3. ***Details*** are the third level of the story map and describe the lowest-granularity interactions that the team anticipates users will experience to complete the step above. For example, Enter username or email and Enter password appear as two separate details underneath the Log in step.
