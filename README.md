## Research

### Agile methods
For this semester i chose for both the projects to use the agile method called SCRUM. I did some research on why to use SCRUM for this type of project and what other methods there are to choose from and what theire benefits are. This product helps prove my proficiency at learning outcome 3: ***Agile method***.\

### Business processes
Some research was done on business processes for helping improve my proficiency on learning outcome 7: ***Business processes***.\

### Distributed Software Systems
One thing that i started doing research on was ***Distrubuted Software Systems***\
[Click here to see the DSS research](https://github.com/Brummer98/Portfolio_BramvHout/blob/de2fdcb2adbf4aeb9cbd4b0e297f46bb86a2d636/Research/DSS.md)

### Ethics
I did some essential research on the Ethics topic. Ethics is where you recognize and take into account cultural differences when working with multi-size teams, and are aware of ethical aspects in software development. I have made an analysis and did some additional research to increase proficiency at learning outcome 5: ***Cultural differences and ethics***.\

### Effective Learning
I also did some research on something that i thought was neccesary especially for me, since i've always had some trouble planning my work.\

## Courses
### React JS Crash Course
Since i was quit new with React JS, i decided to look up on the internet for a simple tutorial to inform me about the most basic functionalities and methods of React.
After searching for a while, i came across a youtube video that explained the entire basic React environment and it's functionalities.\

### LinkedInLearning
After watching the React JS Crash Course, i discovered that trough the portal of Fontys, i could get a FREE account for LinkedInLearning. Which was great news, because 
LinkedIn is a very powerful platform which shows your skills, studies and working experience on the web. Trough completing the LinkedInLearning React JS Essential training, a certificate was added to my profile! Which is a very good thing, so my connections can see that i have the necessary experience with React JS.\

## Software desicions

This document has been written because i wanted to find out how the communication works between the frontend- and the backend software in the FitOne project. Let’s start with working out why we chose the front- and backend that we chose. In this case, Javascript React and ( dot ) NET.

### Frontend – Javascript React
What is the reason that i chose for Javascript React? At first, one of my classmates was excited about React and told me he worked with the software in previous projects. He explained that it worked well with other software and that is was easy to understand and use in a project. This excited me a bit, because i don’t want to spend lots of time understanding a new language. I really want to make a start in the design of the project and start creating those pages, without functionality for now. 

Next to asking people around me why to choose for React, i also went ahead and did some research why it’s such a fine software language to learn. 

Recording to this site: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-use-react-for-web-development/

React is a very flexible type of software, which makes it easy to use on a vast variety of platforms.
React was created with a single focus, which is creating components for webapplications. Which could be a button, text, label or grid. It also is very usefull for altering a smaller part of your code. That is where it is designed for. Maybe there is a component you’d like to change with React, which you can easily do.

### Frontend – Bootstrap 5
Bootstrap ( 5 ) is a frontend toolkit that is great to use in all kinds of webapplications. It’s used for fast component integration and responsive layouts. The Grid system is also a very usefull system for creating a nice layout. You can work with containers, rows and columns, to give the website a complete and functional layout. My experience with Bootstrap has been great, and I have made a few websites with the toolkit. 

### Backend – ASP.Net Core
What is the reason for choosing DOT NET for te FitOne project? Let’s say to start with, I already have the neccesary experience to develop in C#. Last semester we did an entire project using DOT NET MVC. For this part we will only be using C# as a backend tool, so no MVC will be developed. We will be using Javascrip React to develop the frontend of the project. Internet says that the DOT NET framework provides great security, which will help protect the project.

It’s also great with quick deployment. Applications build with the framework can be deployed quickly on any microsoft server. And overal, the software is fairly easy to use.

### Database – Microsoft SQL Server
For me this was an easy decision. I’ve used SQL Server since I started programming for the first time. In comparison to other database systems, I find this one to be the most easy to use. Next to SQL Server, I did do some research on MongoDB. But not using any sql statements seems kind of weird to me. So, naturally I chose SQL Server for this project.

## FitOne ( Individual Project )

FitOne is my individual project and is a web based fitness and food tracking application where users are able to have insights into their daily food consumption and are also able to see how many caloriës they can eat every day. You can add food easily and see directly how many carbs, protein and fat it contains.

### Sprints
I divided the project over an estimated 5 sprints to figure everything out and have a fullstack webapplication by the end of it. That meant planning was necessary to achieve this goal. Since i knew nothing about the framework ***React JS*** i started doing some research in the first sprint. I also did some research on the backend of the webpage, which i made in ***Node.js***. In the second sprint, things came alive. I figured out how to use React JS to create a beautiful frontend webpage for my project. We are now reaching the end of the second sprint and i'll be focussing on getting the backed working in the next sprints.

### SCRUM
I've made use of the SCRUM framework for this project and chose GitHub - projects as the tool to help me manage this process.
[Click here to see the GitHub SCRUM enviroment](https://github.com/users/Brummer98/projects/1/views/1)

### Web application
By using a ***Javacript framework*** like ***React JS***, i help improve my proficiency with learning outcome 1: ***Web application***.

### Software design
For the FitOne application i have made several user stories, requirements and a software architecture diagram. Documentation like such can be found on the ***FitOne software design*** directory. This section is part of proving my proficiency at learning outcome 6: ***Requirements and Design***.

###### What i've learned 
By creating the design document and going trough all of the elements within the document, i've learned several things:\
* I've learned how to determine what requirements are important for the project to be written down, as well as splitting the requirements into functional- and non functional ones. I aslo managed to set priority to those requirements using MoSCoW.
* I've also learned how to develop wireframes to create a view of how the pages roughly are going to look like when the project is finished.
* I've learned how to create a architecture of the entire project, so you can see what kind of systems and other things are going to be connected to the system.
* Creating userstories was not really a new thing that i've learned, but i did improve it during semester 3!

###### My perspective of learning outcome ***Software Design***
As for now i'd say that i've learned enough to give myself a score of ***proficient***. I'm not at a beginning level of design and i've learned enough during semester 2 and 3 to say that i'm experienced enough to grand myself that score.

## WoC ( Group Project )
